Note! This is only suitable for dev environments, not suitable for production.

The below outlines how to use terraform environment variables to declare secrets

Step 1. Create a tf file variables.tf

Step 2. Here is an example of how to declare:
variable "username" {
    description = "Username for the VM"
    type        = string
    sensitive   = true
    default     = "exampleusername"  #Declare here for ease #IMPORTANT! always delete before push to Github #You can leave this out and then each variable will be declared when running a plan/apply 
}

Step 3. Here is an example of how to call.
admin_username = var.username

In a production environment the secrets might be setup using environment variables and devops, 
due to the limitations of an Azure enterprise subscription we cannot use this method.
